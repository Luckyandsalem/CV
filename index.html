    A very dedicated and persistent indivual with over 14 years of healthcare experience.
    Having spent 8 years working in a pharmacy and 6 years in ultrasound, I have obtained excellent communication skills along with customer service skills. My curiosity of the world and how things work has never been higher and my problem solving
    skills are only highly matched with my creative take on how to approach solutions in the workplace.
    <br />
    <br>
    Now, currently looking towards the next chapter in my life which includes putting myself out onto the web on my traveling journey plus learning about breaking into the tech world.
